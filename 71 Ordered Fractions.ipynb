And propably very dumb. But hey, the question is not to create code or mathematical model for all possible cases, but to solve for that particular case. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that there's no analytical way to solve this problem, so why to create numerical method algorithm that will check multiple guesses, if I just can guess the number myself in like ~2 minutes? As I said, this 'solve' might be very dumb. But it worked.",
